-- Step 1: Identify high-value customers
-- Criteria: Must have at least one regular savings plan AND one investment (fund) plan

        ap.owner_id, 
        CONCAT(ac.first_name, ' ', ac.last_name) AS full_name,  -- Combine first and last name
        SUM(ap.is_regular_savings) AS savings_count,

-- Step 2: Calculate the total confirmed deposits per user from savings accounts in naira

-- Step 3: Merge both tables to include customersâ€™ total deposit information
SELECT

    hvc.investment_count,
